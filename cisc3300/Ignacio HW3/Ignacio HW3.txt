Compare and contrast margin, padding, and border.

	Margin serves as the space outside the border of an element. It defines the distance between the element's border and neighboring elements. Margins essentially create breathing room between elements.

	Padding refers to the space between the content of an element and its border. Unlike margin, padding is internal to the element, providing space within its boundaries.

	Border defines the boundary of an element. It wraps around the padding and content, outlining the visible edges of the element. Borders provide structure and definition to elements.
